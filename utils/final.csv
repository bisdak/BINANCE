LED's pack a huge punch of power in an environmentally efficient package, and they are more efficient than traditional incandescent light bulbs. LED's are safer than CFL's (no mercury and fear of breakage), they burn cooler than halogens, and they are much smaller than florescent lights. </p><p><strong>Upgrading is As Easy As Screwing In a Light Bulb</strong></p><p>The TRiLIGHT is as easy as screwing in a light bulb! Just ditch that 60w or 100w bulb and screw in the TRiLIGHT. </p><p><strong>High Light Output with Energy Efficiency</strong></p><p>This innovative light will flood your garage with 3000 lumens of light, but will only use 24 watts of power. For those of you running comparisons in your head, let us help you. A traditional bulb only puts out 800 lumens of light and burns 60 watts, and for those ""mathletes"" out there, here are the numbers. The TRiLIGHT is 3.8 times brighter and 2.5 times more efficient. </p><p><strong>A Light that Senses You</strong></p><p>This motion sensor isn't your old school tech which leaves you jumping and waving to turn the light back on. This is new ""Microwave Motion Sensing Technology"". It is extremely sensitive to even the smallest motions, so you won�t be left in the dark while you are working in your garage. Every time you enter the room, your light will automatically turn on. After 2 minutes of no activity, the TRiLIGHT will turn off. If you happen to be a ""hands on"" type of person, and just insist on using your light switch instead of the motion sensing, just turn the motion sensing feature off and it will work like a normal light bulb.</p><p><strong>Robust Design</strong></p><p>This tribute to the sun is made for the garage, basement, attic, or man cave, and we designed it to fit the room! The robust aluminium heads are as much functional heat sinks as they are works of art. They are mounted to the main body with a friction pivot point, so you can aim the light where you need it. The steel braided wiring adds to the durability and style, and the surface mount 5 Watt, wide-angle LEDs are designed to flood the room with light.</p><p><strong>Daylight White</strong></p><p>The difference is clear. 3.8 times the brightness of a traditional 60 watt bulb is undeniable. You can now easily upgrade the lighting in the largest room in your home, the garage. However, don't play favourites. The other rooms in your house may get jealous of all the mind blowing brightness. Screw this baby into any room your heart desires and enjoy the ""daylight"" 5400k colour temperature that the TRiLIGHT delivers. This colour temperature will have a dramatic effect on any room in your home. Plus, it is proven that daylight makes people happy. We aren't officially claiming that the TRiLIGHT is mood altering or anything, but it makes us happy! The feeling may be contagious! </p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>Finally, forget about changing out a dead bulb from time to time. The LED's will burn for over 50,000 hours, and the TRiLIGHT comes with a three year warranty.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>FEATURES AND BENEFITS</strong></td><td>TRILIGHT</td><td>Light Bulb</td><td>Shop Light</td></tr><tr><td>Quick No Tool Installation</td><td>YES </td><td>YES</td><td>NO </td></tr><tr><td>Motion Sensor</td><td>YES </td><td>NO </td><td>NO </td></tr><tr><td>Adjustable Heads to aim light</td><td>YES </td><td>NO </td><td>NO </td></tr><tr><td>Designed to work with light switch</td><td>YES </td><td>YES </td><td>NO </td></tr><tr><td>Brightness</td><td>3000 lumens</td><td>800 lumens</td><td>VariesTypically less than TRiLIGHT</td></tr><tr><td>Power Consumption</td><td>24 watts</td><td>60 watts</td><td>VariesTypically more than TRiLIGHT</td></tr><tr><td>Requires extension cord</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Possibly</td></tr><tr><td>Requires professional install</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Some Models</td></tr><tr><td>Average life of light or bulb</td><td>50,000 hours</td><td>Average 1000 hours</td><td>Variesbetween bulb &amp; ballast failures</td></tr><tr><td>Survives drop test on concrete</td><tr><td>Requires additional hardware</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yesbulbs &amp; adapters sold separately</td></tr><td><strong>BEST OPTION</strong>Performance &amp; Easy Install</td><p>Striker provide users with functional, innovative and useful products, making sure everything is researched, designed and tested by professionals to create and engineer amazing solutions for reliability and performance.</p>"	<p>Features</p><ul><li>GTIN: 894717003429</li></ul>	https://www.powabeam.com.au/images/detailed/12/B-00342-striker-trilight-garage-sensor-light.jpg	https://www.powabeam.com.au/images/detailed/12/B-00342-striker-trilight-garage-sensor-light.jpg

https://www.powabeam.com.au/pl175-hand-held-hid-55.html	Powa Beam 	PL175HID-55	PL175HID-55	Spotlights / Hand Held Spotlights	"175mm/7"" HID 55W Hand Held Spotlight"	$345.00		In stock		"<p><strong>Powa Beam 7"" 55W Xenon HID Spotlight Hand Held Spotlight.</strong></p><p>This spotlight has a 175mm (7"") diameter case with an all metal construction. It basically has the same reflector, case, bracket and quality handle as the PL175 halogen spotlight however it has a High Intensity Discharge (HID) globe, with the ballast mounted on the back of the case. The standard globe used in this light has a 5000K colour temperature and is 12v 55w. </p><p><strong>Adjustable Focus System</strong></p><p>These spotlights are fitted with adjustable-focused reflector that makes focusing your beam so much easier. You take the case off, unscrew the lock ring, and spin your reflector until you see the beam you want. Once you have that beam set, simply screw the lock ring back on, put it back in the case and you're set to go. No longer will you need to remove the glass and risk damaging your reflector.</p><p>Like all Powa Beam Spotlights, the PL175HID is hand focused for maximum performance and every part is replaceable.</p><p><strong>What is HID?</strong></p><p>HID lighting system stand for High Intensity Discharge Lamp. The HID lamp is a system that produces light by putting xenon gas and metal halide salts into the light emitting tube installed inside the HID lamp. The electrons inside the light emitting tube collide with the metal atoms, using 20,000 volts generated from the control system (ballast) to produce light. </p><p><strong>Work Theory:</strong></p><p><strong>Bulb: </strong>The Xenon Gas and mercury Metal Halide Salts existing inside the light emitting tube causes the molybdenum electrodes on both sides to plasma discharge and create energy, which in turn produces light.</p><p><strong>Ignitor:</strong> This is an electronic amplifier that receives electric current from the ballast and boosts voltage to ignite the Arc Light Source in all environments.

With a Powa Beam light you can have the confidence of knowing that they are made from premium quality materials including alloy reflectors and cases that are able to withstand the harsh Australian climate. In the event that your bulb may blow or you have accidentally damaged the light, no matter what part you require, it will be available.</p><p><strong>Performance</strong> � Powa Beam Spotlights have been regarded as one of the best on the market for over 60 years.

It has a 245mm (9"") diameter case with an all metal construction. It basically has the same reflector, case, bracket and quality reinforcements (with slight modifications) as the Halogen Pro-9 spotlight however it has a High Intensity Discharge (HID) globe, with the ballast completely mounted inside the case. The standard globe used in this light has a 5000k Neutral White Light and is 9-32v, 70w.</p><ul><li>Wattage: 70</li><li>Colour Temperature: 5,000K Neutral White Light</li><li>Case Diameter: 245mm (9"")</li><li>Weight: 1.7kg</li><li>UPC: 793573 606525</li></ul><p><strong>Adjustable Focus System</strong></p><p>These spotlights are fitted with adjustable-focused reflector that makes focusing your beam so much easier. You take the case off, unscrew the lock ring, and spin your reflector until you see the beam you want. Once you have that beam set, simply screw the lock ring back on, put it back in the case and you're set to go. No longer will you need to remove the glass and risk damaging your reflector.</p><p>Like all Powa Beam Spotlights, the Pro-9HID is hand focused for maximum performance and every part is replaceable.This spotlight is a must have for all Professional Shooters and will blow all other hunting spotlights away.</p><p><strong>Precautions:</strong></p><p><strong>Do not touch the HID bulb, ballast and cord after turning on the system: </strong>It generates 20,000 voltage while turned on and may cause burns or fatal accidents by electric shock, as well as shorten the lifespan of the bulb.</p><p><strong>Do not turn on/off frequently: </strong>It will shorten the lifespan of the bulb. It may also cause the HID bulb not to turn on which is an indication that the safety circuit is activated on the ballast and it is not a fault. Wait a while then turn it back on.</p><p><strong>If HID turns off while in use: </strong>Turn it off at the switch and wait approximately 15min then turn it on again. If the bulb returns to its normal condition then this indicates that a safety switch was activated and you can continue using the light. If there is no improvement then contact the store you purchased the light from.</p><p>Powa Beam has been manufacturing the highest quality spotlights since 1969.

You can stop this by a placing a small amount of Inox or WD40 at the top lip of the rubber boot where it meets the shaft.The washers are made to be self lubricating therefore should not need additional oiling. If your remote is still squeaking, try a very small amount of Inox or WD40 at the top of the ball joint. Please note too much may cause the ball shaft to slip, therefore reducing its ability to hold tension.</p> Is it legal to install a remote in my vehicle? There is currently no law stating that roof mounted spotlights are illegal.
